//Basics
//variables
let age = 25;
let year = 2019;

console.log(age, year); //25 2019

//we can change the value

age = 30;
console.log(age); //30

//if we use const keyword we can't change the value

const point = 100;
//point = 50 => we will get an error

//old way to creat variables
var score = 75;
console.log(score);

//we write variable names in camel case we can't use spaces
//variables can't start with numbers
//we can't use reserved keywords for variables

//we use // for single line comments
//we use /* */ for multi-line comments
